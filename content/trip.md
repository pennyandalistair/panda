# Getting to the venue/hotel

We thought many people would rent a car - so we've created a form to facilitate carpooling. You can fill in the form here:

We'll get in touch very soon to coordinate you all!

# Getting around

If you are staying within Toronto, then public transportation is your best option.
Parking tends to be $15 for the day. You can pay for all fares by cash, but a better option is to buy tokens or tickets at a metro stop, as they are cheaper.

You can find more info at the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) website:
https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Prices/index.jsp

If you're not staying in Toronto, or in the Greater Toronto Area, you can consider GO Trains for getting in/out of Toronto, or traveling to cities further away.
You can find maps here: http://www.gotransit.com/timetables/en/schedules/maps.aspx

Taking the GO train into Toronto is usually only worth it for two people. If you have more, parking in Toronto will probably end up being cheaper.

# Attractions

## Inside toronto

There is loads to see inside Toronto! Here are some of our personal favorites.

### CN Tower

You can't visit Toronto without also visiting the Canadian National (CN) Tower, the big pointy thing in the middle of the city. I used to call it the tallest tower in the world but that hasn't been true for six years now :( it's still really cool to visit though! You get great views both indoor and outdoor (be warned there is a bit of a breeze), and there is a glass floor to stand on.. if you are brave enough. If you are *really* crazy, you can book an "edge walk" where they hang you from the side of the building. The downside is it's a bit pricey at $35 to visit the tower for adults. One good tip is that entrance is complimentary if you eat at the *360 restaurant* (CN tower) - their two course prix fixe menu is $56 - so you can treat yourself to a fancy meal and feel like you are saving money :)
